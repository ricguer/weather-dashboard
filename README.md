# Weather Dashboard

## Description
This application retrieves weather data for cities through form inputs and calls to the OpenWeather API. The user is able to submit the name of a city and retrieve the current weather conditions of the city as well as a five day forecast. As the user looks up the weather of different cities, their searches are saved for reference.
